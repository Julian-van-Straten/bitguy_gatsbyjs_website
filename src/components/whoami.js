                <p>My name is Julian. I was born in a jungle in India. When I was just a boy my village was viciously attacked by a tiger and his hyena. On a quest to find my parents I got terribly lost and was taken into care by two wolves who are now like parents to me.
                <br/><br></br>Not really though. Iâ€™m actually just your average nerd, living in Bournemouth, with 2 cats and a lifelong passion for fixing things.</p>
